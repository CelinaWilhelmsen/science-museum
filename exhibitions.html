          On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
          exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of
          installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
          elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
          ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
          to create power.

            about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
            the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
            journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to

            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
            question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
            here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
            know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
            meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
            Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
            the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
            and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
            planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
            create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
            planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers
            we currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
            and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
            contribute to a brighter future.
